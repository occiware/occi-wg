\section{OCCI RESTful HTTP Protocol}

This document specifies the OCCI HTTP Protocal, a RESTful protocol for
communication between OCCI Server and OCCI Client. The OCCI HTTP Protocol
support multiple different data formats as payload. Data formats are specified
an separate documents.

{\em TBD: general intro to REST etc}

\section{Namespace}

The OCCI HTTP Protocol maps the OCCI Core model into the URL hierarchy by binding
\hl{Kind} and \hl{Mixin} instances to unique URL paths. Such a URL path is called
the {\em location} of the \hl{Kind} or \hl{Mixin}.
A provider is free to choose the {\em location} as long as it is unique
within the service provider's URL namespace.
For example, the \hl{Kind} instance%
\footnote{\tt http://schemas.ogf.org/occi/infrastructure\#compute}
for the \hl{Compute} type may be bound to {\tt /my/occi/api/compute/}.

A \hl{Kind} instance whose associated type cannot be instantiated MUST NOT be
bound to an URL path. This applies to the \hl{Kind} instance for OCCI Entity
which, according to OCCI Core, cannot be instantiated \cite{occi:core}.

\todo{sub resources here.}

\subsection{Bound and unbound paths}

Since a limited set of URL paths are bound to \hl{Kind} and \hl{Mixin}
instances the URL hierarchy consists of both {\em bound} and {\em unbound}
paths.
A bound URL path is the {\em location} of a \hl{Kind} or \hl{Mixin} collection.

An unbound URL path MAY represent the union of all \hl{Kind} and \hl{Mixin}
collection ``below'' the unbound path.
\todo{FIXME: Should this be a MUST instead?}

\section{Headers and status codes}

\todo{add all other HTTP niftyness from old spec here.}

OCCI Clients and Servers must include a minimum set of mandatory HTTP headers
in each request and response in order to be compliant.
There is also a minimum set of HTTP status codes which must be supported by
an implementation of the OCCI HTTP Protocol.

\subsection{Mandatory HTTP requests headers}

\begin{description}
\item[Accept] An OCCI Client SHOULD specify the media-types the OCCI data
formats it supports in the {\tt Accept} header.

\item[Content-type] If an OCCI Client submits payload in a HTTP request
the OCCI Client MUST specify the media-type of the OCCI data format
in the {\tt Content-type} header.
\end{description}

\subsection{Mandatory HTTP response headers}

\begin{description}
\item[Content-type] An OCCI Server MUST specify the media-type of the OCCI data
format used in a HTTP Response.
\item[Server] An OCCI Server MUST specify the OCCI HTTP Protocol version number.
\end{description}

\subsection{HTTP status codes}

The below list specifies the minimum set of HTTP status codes an OCCI Client MUST
understand. An OCCI Server MAY return other HTTP status codes but the exact client
behaviour in such cases is not specified.

\begin{description}
\item[200]
\item[204]
\item[301]
\item[400]
\item[403]
\item[404]
\item[405]
\end{description}


\section{HTTP methods applied to entity instance URLs}

\todo{Sanity check this section against v1.1...}

This section describes the HTTP methods used to retrieve and manipulate
individual entity instances. An {\em entity instance} refers to an instance
of the OCCI \hl{Resource} type, OCCI \hl{Link} type or a sub-type thereof
\cite{occi:core}.

Each HTTP method described is assumed to operate
on an URL referring to a single element in a collection, an URL such as the
following:
\begin{verbatim}
  http://example.com/compute/012d2b48-c334-47f2-9368-557e75249042
\end{verbatim}


\subsection{GET entity instance}
The HTTP GET method retrieves a representation of a single (existing)
entity instance.

\subsubsection{Client GET request}
The body of the HTTP GET request MUST be empty.
\begin{verbatim}
GET /compute/012d2b48-c334-47f2-9368-557e75249042 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Accept: application/occi+xxx
User-Agent: occi-client/x.x OCCI/1.1
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Server GET response}
% HTTP status: 200
The body of the HTTP GET response MUST contain a representation of the entity
instance.
\begin{verbatim}
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: occi-server/x.x OCCI/1.1
Content-Type: application/occi+xxx; charset=utf-8

...
\end{verbatim}


\subsection{PUT entity instance}
The HTTP PUT method either {\em creates} a new or {\em replaces} an existing
entity instance at the specified URL.
%
The unique identifier of the entity instance (\hl{Entity}.{\tt id}) MUST be
specified in the request URL.
An OCCI Client MAY also specify \hl{Entity}.{\tt id} in the payload however it
MUST be identical to the identifier specified as part of the request URL.

If an entity instance with the specified identifier does not exist the PUT
request allows the OCCI Client to choose the \hl{Entity}.{\tt id} of the new
instance.
An OCCI Server MAY refuse such a request with HTTP status code 405. This would
indicate that the OCCI Server does not allow user defined entity identifiers.

The PUT method MUST be idempotent, i.e. multiple identical PUT requests should
have the same effect as a single request.


\subsubsection{Client PUT request}
The full representation of the entity instance MUST be supplied in the HTTP
body of the request. The request body MUST only include a representation of
a single entity instance.

If the request represent an OCCI \hl{Resource} (as opposed to an OCCI
\hl{Link}) the representation MUST NOT include any \hl{Link} instances
associated with the \hl{Resource} instance.
A server MUST refuse a request including associated \hl{Link}s

Any OCCI \hl{Link}s associated with an existing OCCI \hl{Resource} MUST be left
intact.
\begin{verbatim}
PUT /compute/012d2b48-c334-47f2-9368-557e75249042 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Accept: application/occi-entity+json
User-Agent: occi-client/x.x OCCI/1.1
Content-Type: application/occi-entity+json; charset=utf-8

{
  "kind": "http://schemas.ogf.org/occi/infrastructure#compute",
  "mixins": [ ... ],
  "attributes": { ... }
}
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Server PUT response}
\begin{description}
\item[Content-Type] {\tt application/occi-entity+json}
\end{description}
Upon success an OCCI server MUST return HTTP status code 200 and a complete
JSON representation of the created/replaced entity instance in
single-entity-instance format.
The response MUST be identical%
\footnote{Provided the entity instance was not changed in the meantime.}
to that of a subsequent GET request of the same URL.

\begin{verbatim}
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: occi-server/x.x OCCI/1.1
Content-Type: application/occi-entity+json; charset=utf-8

{
  "kind": "http://schemas.ogf.org/occi/infrastructure#compute",
  "mixins": [ ... ],
  "actions": [ ... ],
  "links": [ ... ],
  "attributes": { ... }
}
\end{verbatim}


\subsection{POST entity instance (action)}
There are two methods to invoke an OCCI Action using the JSON Rendering.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Supply the query parameter ``action'' together with the request. The value
of ``action'' MUST be the {\tt term} of the action \hl{Category}.
\item Specify {\tt application/occi-action+json} in the Content-Type header
and supply a request payload formatted according to section~\ref{sec:format_action}.
In order to specify action attributes this method MUST be used.
\end{enumerate}
An OCCI Client MAY combine the two methods if the ``action'' parameter's value
is equal to the \hl{Category} {\tt term} in the body.

\subsubsection{Client POST action request}
\begin{description}
\item[Accept] {\tt application/occi-entity+json}
\item[Content-Type] {\tt application/occi-action+json}
\end{description}
The example shows the combined method.
\begin{verbatim}
POST /compute/012d2b48-c334-47f2-9368-557e75249042?action=stop HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Accept: application/occi-entity+json
User-Agent: occi-client/x.x OCCI/1.1
Content-Type: application/occi-action+json; charset=utf-8

{
  "category": "http://schemas.ogf.org/occi/infrastructure/compute/action#stop",
  "attributes": {
    "method": "graceful"
  }
}
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Server POST action response}
\begin{description}
\item[Content-Type] {\tt application/occi-entity+json}
\end{description}
If the request Accept header contains {\tt application/occi-entity+json} the
server MAY return status code 200 and a full representation of the entity instance.
Otherwise the server MUST return status code 204 and no response payload.
\begin{verbatim}
HTTP/1.1 204 OK
Server: occi-server/x.x OCCI/1.1
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{POST entity instance}
\begin{description}
\item[Content-Type] {\tt application/occi-entity+json}
\end{description}
\todo{This would imply a partial update of the entity instance. While it is
easy to supply only the attributes to be updated the question is if there are any
valid use cases for partial updates using JSON?}

\subsection{DELETE entity instance}
The HTTP DELETE method destroys an entity instance and any OCCI Links
associated with an OCCI Resource.

\subsubsection{Client DELETE request}
\begin{description}
\item[Content-Type] {\tt application/occi-entity+json}
\end{description}
\begin{verbatim}
DELETE /compute/012d2b48-c334-47f2-9368-557e75249042 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Accept: application/occi-entity+json
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Server DELETE response}
\begin{verbatim}
HTTP/1.1 204 OK
Server: occi-server/x.x OCCI/1.1
\end{verbatim}


\section{HTTP methods applied to collections URLs}

\todo{NOT fully updated yet!}

This section describes the HTTP methods used to manipulate collections. Each
HTTP method described is assumed to operate on an URL referring to a collection
of elements, an URL such as the following:
\begin{verbatim}
  http://example.com/storage/
\end{verbatim}

A collection consist of a set of entity instances and there are three
different types of collections which may be exposed by an OCCI server.  The
request and response format is identical for all three types collections
although the semantics differ slightly for the PUT and POST methods.
\begin{description}
\item[Kind locations] The location associated with an OCCI Kind instance
represents the collection of all entity instances of that particular Kind.
\item[Mixin locations] The location of an OCCI Mixin instance represents the
collection of all entity instances associated with that Mixin.
\item[Arbitrary path] Any path in the URL namespace which is neither a Kind nor
a Mixin location. A typical example is the root URL e.g.~{\tt
http://example.com/}. Such a path combines all collections in the sub-tree
starting at the path. Therefore the root URL is a collection of all entity
instances available.
\end{description}

\subsection{GET collection}
The HTTP GET method retrieves a list of all entity instances in the
collection. Filtering and pagination information is encoded in the query string
of the URL.

\subsubsection{Client GET request}
The query string of the request URL MUST have the following format:
\begin{verbatim}
query-string        = ""
                    | "?" query-parameter *( "&" query-parameter )
  query-parameter   = attribute-filter
                    | category-filter
                    | pagination-marker
                    | pagination-limit
  attribute-filter  = "q=" attribute-search *( "+" attribute-search )
  attribute-search  = 1*( string-urlencoded |
                          attribute-name "%3D" string-urlencoded )
  category-filter   = "category=" string-urlencoded
  pagination-marker = "marker=" UUID
  pagination-limit  = "limit=" 1*( DIGIT )
  attribute-name    = attr-component *( "." attr-component )
  attr-component    = LOALPHA *( LOALPHA | DIGIT | "-" | "_" )
  string-urlencoded = *( ALPHA | DIGIT | "-" | "_" | "." | "~" | "%" )

\end{verbatim}
\todo{FIXME: UUID in ABNF}

\paragraph*{Filtering} A search filter can be applied to categories and attributes
of entity instances in a collection. An OCCI server SHOULD support filtering.
The query parameters MUST be URL encoded.

Attribute filters are specified using the {\em q} query parameter.  A filter such
as {\tt q=ubuntu+inactive} would match all entity instances whose combined
set of attribute values includes both the word ``ubuntu'' and ``inactive''. It
is also possible to match on specific attributes by preceding the search term
with the attribute name and an equal sign, for example {\tt
occi.core.title\%3Dubuntu+occi.compute.state\%3Dinactive}.

The category filter is specified using the {\em category} query parameter and
represent a single Kind, Mixin or Action category to be matched. The following
query would include only entity instances of the Compute type:
{\tt category=http\%3A\%2F\%2Fschemas.ogf.org\%2Focci\%2Finfrastructure\%23compute}

\paragraph*{Pagination}
\todo{FIXME: marker instead of start}
\label{sec:collection:pagination}
An OCCI client MAY request that the server only return
a subset of a collection. This is accomplished using the {\em marker} and
{\em limit} query parameters.  An OCCI server MUST support pagination.

The {\em marker} parameter specifies the offset into the collection. A value of
zero, {\tt marker=0} indicates the beginning of the collection.
%
The {\em limit} parameter sets the maximum number of elements to include in the
response. For example {\tt ?marker=...\&limit=10} would indicate the third page
with a limit of 10 elements per page.

\paragraph*{Example request}

\begin{verbatim}
GET /storage/?q=ubuntu+server&limit=20 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Accept: application/occi-collection+json
User-Agent: occi-client/x.x OCCI/1.1
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Server GET response}
\begin{verbatim}
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: occi-server/x.x OCCI/1.1
Content-Type: application/occi-collection+json; charset=utf-8

{
  "collection": [
    {
      "kind": "..." ,
      "mixins": [ ... ],
      "actions": [ ... ],
      "links": [ ... ],
      "attributes": { ... },
    },
    { ... },
    { ... }
  ],
  "limit": 20,
  "size": 137,
  "next": "http://example.com/storage/?q=ubuntu+server&marker=59b50...9b3&limit=20"
}
\end{verbatim}


\subsection{POST collection}
The HTTP POST method is used to create/update one or more entity instances in
a single atomic request. An OCCI server MUST identify existing entity instances
using the {\tt occi.core.id} attribute.

\subsubsection{Client POST request}
\begin{verbatim}
POST /storage/ HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Accept: application/occi-collection+json
User-Agent: occi-client/x.x OCCI/1.1
Content-Type: application/occi-collection+json; charset=utf-8

{
  "collection": [
    {
      "kind": "...",
      "mixins": [ ... ],
      "links": [ ... ],
      "attributes": { ... },
    },
    { ... },
    { ... }
  ]
}
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Server POST response}
\begin{verbatim}
HTTP/1.1 204 OK
Server: occi-server/x.x OCCI/1.1
\end{verbatim}
\todo{Should we support HTTP 200 returning the whole collection? Or maybe just the entity instances created/updated?}

\begin{comment}
\section{More examples}
The OCCI demo instance of occi-py%
\footnote{\tt http://github.com/nyren/occi-py}
running at {\tt http://www.nyren.net/api/} has an early version of the draft
JSON rendering available.  Feel free to play around with it. However, please
note the following limitations:
\begin{itemize}
\item The Content-Type is {\tt application/json} and not {\tt application/occi+json}
which would be more appropriate.
\item It does not support request data in JSON.
\item Filtering and pagination is not yet supported.
\end{itemize}

A few example queries using curl:
\begin{verbatim}
curl -i -H 'accept: application/json' http://www.nyren.net/api/-/
curl -i -H 'accept: application/json' http://www.nyren.net/api/link/
curl -i -X POST -H 'accept: application/json' http://www.nyren.net/api/compute/
