    cloud infrastructure services (also known as Infrastructure as a Service
    or IaaS) which strictly adheres to REpresentational State Transfer (REST)
    principles and is closely tied to HyperText Tranfer Protocol (HTTP). For
    simplicity and scalability reasons it specifically avoids Remote Procedure
    Call (RPC) style interfaces and can essentially be implemented as a
    horizontally scalable document repository with which both nodes and
    clients interact.</p><p>This document describes a step-by-step walkthrough of performing
    various tasks as at the time of writing.</p></div><div class="section" title="Getting Started"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="id36063472"/>Getting Started</h2></div></div></div><h3><a id="id36063477"/>Connecting</h3><p>Each implementation has a single OCCI end-point URL (we'll use
    http://example.com/) and everything you need to know is linked from this
    point - configuring clients is just a case of providing this parameter. In
    the simplest case the end-point may contain only a single resource or type
    of resource (e.g. a hypervisor burnt into the BIOS of a motherboard
    exposing compute resources, a network switch/router exposing network
    resources or a SAN exposing storage resources) and at the other end of the
    spectrum it may provide access to a global cloud infrastructure (e.g. the
    "Great Global Grid" or GGG). You will only ever see those resources to
    which you have access to (typically all of them for a private cloud or a
    small subset for a public cloud) and flexible categorisation and search
    provide fine-grained control which resources are returned, allowing OCCI
    to handle the largest of installations. You will always connect to this
    end-point over HTTP(S) and given the simplicity of the interface most
    user-agents are suitable, including libraries (e.g. urllib2, LWP), command
    line tools (e.g. curl, wget) and full blown browsers (e.g.
    Firefox).</p><h3><a id="id36063484"/>Authenticating</h3><p>When you connect you will normally be challenged to authenticate via
    HTTP (this is not always the case - in secure/offline environments it may
    not be necessary) and will need to do so via the specified mechanism. It
    is anticipated that most implementations will require HTTP Basic
    Authentication over SSL/TLS so at the very least you should support this
    (fortunately almost all user-agents already do), but more advanced
    mechanisms such as NTLM or Kerberos may be deployed. Certain types of
    accesses (such as a compute resource querying OCCI for introspection and
    configuration) may be possible anonymously (having already been
    authenticated by interface and/or IP address). Should you be redirected by
    the API to a node, storage device, etc. (for example, to retrieve a large
    binary representation) then you should either be able to transparently
    authenticate or a signed URL should be provided. That is, a single set of
    credentials is all that is required to access the entire system from any
    point.</p><h3><a id="id36063490"/>Representations</h3><p>As the resource itself (e.g. a physical machine, storage array or
    network switch) cannot be transferred over HTTP (at least not yet!) we
    instead make available one or more representations of that resource. For
    example, an API modeling a person might return a picture, fingerprints,
    identity document(s) or even a digitised DNA sequence, but not the person
    themselves. A circle might be represented by SVG drawing primatives or any
    three distinct points on the curve. For cloud infrastructure there are
    many useful representations, and while OCCI standardises a number of them
    for interoperability purposes, an implementation is free to implement
    others in order to best serve the specific needs of their users and to
    differentiate from other offerings. Other examples include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Open Cloud Computing Interface (OCCI) descriptor format
        (application/occi+xml)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Open Virtualisation Format (OVF) file
        (application/ovf+xml?)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Open Virtualisation Archive (OVA) file
        (application/x-ova?)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Screenshot of the console (image/png)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Access to the console (application/x-vnc)</p></li></ul></div><p>The client indicates which representation(s) it desires by way of
    the URL and/or HTTP Accept headers (e.g. HTTP Content Negotiation) and if
    the server is unable to satisfy the request then it should return HTTP 406
    Not Acceptable.</p><h3><a id="id36063547"/>Descriptors</h3><p>In addition to the protocol itself, OCCI defines a simple key/value
    based descriptor format for cloud infrastructure resources:</p><div class="glosslist"><dl><dt>compute</dt><dd><p>Provides computational services, ranging from dedicated
          physical machines (e.g. Dedibox) to virtual machines (e.g. Amazon
          EC2) to slices/zones/containers (e.g. Mosso Cloud Servers).</p></dd><dt>network</dt><dd><p>Provides connectivity between machines and the outside world.
          Usually virtual and may or may not be connected to a physical
          segment.</p></dd><dt>storage</dt><dd><p>Provides storage services, typically via magnetic mass storage
          devices (e.g. hard drives, RAID arrays, SANs).</p></dd></dl></div><p>Given the simplicity of the format it is trivial to translate
    between wire formats including plain text, JSON, XML and others. For
    example:</p><pre class="screen">occi.compute.cores 2
compute.speed 3200
compute.memory 2048</pre><h3><a id="id36063608"/>Identifiers</h3><p>Each resource is identified by its dereferenceable URL which is by
    definition unique, giving information about the origin and type of the
    resource as well as a local identifier (the combination of which forms a
    globally unique compound key). The primary drawback is that the more
    information that goes into the key (and therefore the more transparent it
    is), the more likely it is to change. For example, if you migrate a
    resource from one implementation to another then its identifier will
    change (though in this instance the source should provide a HTTP 301 Moved
    Permanently response along with the new location, assuming it is known, or
    HTTP 410 Gone otherwise).</p><p>In order to realise the benefit of transparent, dereferenceable
    identifiers while still being able to track resources through their entire
    lifecycle an immutable UUID attribute should be allocated which will
    remain with the resource throughout its life. This is particularly
    important where the same resource (e.g. a network) appears in multiple
    places.</p><p>New implementations should use type 4 (random) UUIDs anyway, as
    these can be safely allocated by any node without consulting a
    register/sequence, but where existing identifiers are available they
    should be used instead (e.g.
    http://amazon.com/compute/ami-ef48af86).</p></div><div class="section" title="Operations"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="id36063634"/>Operations</h2></div></div></div><h3><a id="id36063639"/>Create</h3><p>To create a resource simply POST it to the appropropriate collection
    (e.g. /compute, /network or /storage) as an HTML form (supported by
    virtually all user agents) or in another supported format (e.g.
    OVF):</p><pre class="screen">POST /compute HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Length: 35
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

compute.cores=2&amp;compute.memory=2048</pre><p>Rather than generating the new resource from scratch you may also be
    given the option to GET a template and POST or PUT it back (for example,
    where "small", "medium" and "large" instances or pre-configured appliances
    are offered).</p><h3><a id="id36063659"/>Retrieve</h3><p>The simplest command is to retrieve a single resource by conducting
    a HTTP GET on its URL (which doubles as its identifier):</p><pre class="screen">GET /compute/b10fa926-41a6-4125-ae94-bfad2670ca87 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com</pre><p>This will return <em><span class="remark">a HTTP 300 Multiple Choices response
    containing a list of available representations for the resource as well as
    a suggestion in the form of a HTTP Location: header of</span></em> the
    default rendering, which should be HTML (thereby allowing standard
    browsers to access the API directly). An arbitrary number of alternatives
    may also be returned by way of HTTP Link: headers.</p><p>If you just need to know what representations are available you
    should make a HEAD request instead of a GET - this will return the
    metadata in the headers without the default rendering.</p><p>Some requests (such as searches) will need to return a collection of
    resources. There are two options:</p><div class="glosslist"><dl><dt>Pass-by-reference</dt><dd><p>A plain text or HTML list of links is provided but each needs
          to be retrieved separately, resulting in O(n+1) performance.</p></dd><dt>Pass-by-value</dt><dd><p>A wrapper format such as Atom is used to deliver [links to]
          the content as well as the metadata (e.g. links, associations,
          cahching information, etc.), resulting in O(1) performance.</p></dd></dl></div><h3><a id="id36063721"/>Update</h3><p>Updating resources is trivial - simply GET the resource, modify it
    as necessary and PUT it back where you found it.</p><h3><a id="id36063728"/>Delete</h3><p>Simply <code class="computeroutput">DELETE</code> the resource:</p><pre class="screen">DELETE /compute/b10fa926-41a6-4125-ae94-bfad2670ca87 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com</pre></div><div class="section" title="Sub-resource Collections"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="id36063743"/>Sub-resource Collections</h2></div></div></div><p><em><span class="remark">(For want of a better name) </span></em></p><p>Each resource may expose collections for functions such as logging,
    auditing, change control, documentation and other operations (e.g.
    http://example.com/compute/123/log/456) in addition to any required by
    OCCI. As usual CRUD operations map to HTTP verbs (as above) and clients
    can either PUT entries directly if they know or will generate the
    identifiers, or POST them to the collection if this will be handled on the
    server side (using POST Once Exactly (POE) to ensure idempotency).</p><h3><a id="id36063760"/>Requests</h3><p>Requests are used to trigger state changes and other operations such
    as backups, snapshots, migrations and invasive reconfigurations (such as
    storage resource resizing). Those that do not complete immediately
    (returning HTTP 200 OK or similar) must be handled asynchronously
    (returning HTTP 201 Accepted or similar).</p><pre class="screen">POST /compute/123/requests HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Length: 35
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

state=shutdown&amp;type=acpioff</pre><p>The actual operation may not start immediately (for example, backups
    which are only handled daily at midnight) and may take some time to
    complete (for example a secure erase which requires multiple passes over
    the disk). Clients can poll for status periodically or use server push (or
    a non-HTTP technology such as XMPP) to monitor for events.</p></div></div></body></html>
