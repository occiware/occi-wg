Term & Description \\
\hline
\hl{Action} & An OCCI base type. Represents an invocable operation on an \hl{Entity} sub-type instance or collection thereof. \\

\hl{Attribute} & A type in the OCCI Core Model. Describes the name and properties of attributes found in \hl{Entity} types. \\

\hl{Category} & A type in the OCCI Core Model and the basis of the OCCI type identification mechanism. The parent type of \hl{Kind}. \\

capabilities & In the context of \hl{Entity} sub-types {\bf  capabilities} refer
  to the \hl{Attribute}s and \hl{Action}s exposed by an {\bf entity
  instance}. \\

\hl{Collection} & A set of \hl{Entity} sub-type instances all associated to a particular \hl{Kind} or \hl{Mixin} instance. \\

\hl{Entity} & An OCCI base type. The parent type of \hl{Resource} and \hl{Link}. \\

entity instance & An instance of a sub-type of \hl{Entity} but not an instance
  of the \hl{Entity} type itself.  The OCCI model defines two sub-types of
  \hl{Entity}: the \hl{Resource} type and the \hl{Link} type.  However, the
  term {\em entity instance} is defined to include any instance of a
  sub-type of \hl{Resource} or \hl{Link} as well. \\

\hl{Kind} & A type in the OCCI Core Model. A core component of the OCCI classification system. \\

\hl{Link} & An OCCI base type. A \hl{Link} instance associates one \hl{Resource} instance with another. \\

\hl{Mixin} & A type in the OCCI Core Model. A core component of the OCCI classification system. \\

mix-in & An instance of the \hl{Mixin} type associated with an {\em entity
 instance}. The ``mix-in'' concept as used by OCCI {\em only} applies to
 instances, never to \hl{Entity} types. \\

\hl{OCCI} & Open Cloud Computing Interface. \\

OGF & Open Grid Forum. \\

\hl{Resource} & An OCCI base type. The parent type for all domain-specific \hl{Resource} sub-types. \\

resource instance & See {\em entity instance}. This term is considered obsolete. \\

tag & A \hl{Mixin} instance with no attributes or actions defined. Used for taxonomic organisation of entity instances.\\

template & A \hl{Mixin} instance which if associated at instance
creation-time pre-populate certain attributes. \\

type & One of the types defined by the OCCI Core Model.  The Core Model types are
 \hl{Category}, \hl{Attribute},
 \hl{Kind}, \hl{Mixin}, \hl{Action}, \hl{Entity}, \hl{Resource}
 and \hl{Link}. \\

concrete type/sub-type & A concrete type/sub-type is a type that can be instantiated.\\

URI & Uniform Resource Identifier. \\
URL & Uniform Resource Locator. \\
URN & Uniform Resource Name. \\
