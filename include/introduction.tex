The Open Cloud Computing Interface (OCCI) is a RESTful Protocol and
API for all kinds of management tasks. OCCI was originally initiated
to create a remote management API for IaaS%
\footnote{Infrastructure as a Service}
model-based services, allowing for the development of interoperable tools for
common tasks including deployment, autonomic scaling and monitoring.
%
It has since evolved into a flexible API with a strong focus on
interoperability while still offering a high degree of extensibility. The
current release of the Open Cloud Computing Interface is suitable to serve many
other models in addition to IaaS, including PaaS and SaaS.

In order to be modular and extensible the current OCCI specification is
released as a suite of complimentary documents, which together form the complete
specification.
%
The documents are divided into three categories consisting of the OCCI Core,
the OCCI Renderings and the OCCI Extensions.
%
\begin{itemize}
\item The OCCI Core specification consists of a single document defining the
 OCCI Core Model. The OCCI Core Model can be interacted through {\em
 renderings} (including associated behaviours) and expanded through {\em extensions}.
\item The OCCI Rendering specifications consist of multiple documents each
 describing a particular rendering of the OCCI Core Model. Multiple renderings can
 interact with the same instance of the OCCI Core Model and will automatically support
 any additions to the model which follow the extension rules defined in OCCI
 Core.
\item The OCCI Extension specifications consist of multiple documents each
 describing a particular extension of the OCCI Core Model. The extension documents
 describe additions to the OCCI Core Model defined within the OCCI specification
 suite. They do not require changes to the HTTP Rendering specifications as of this version of the specification.
\end{itemize}
%
The current specification consists of three documents. This
specification describes version 1.1 of OCCI. Future releases of OCCI
may include additional rendering and extension specifications. The
documents of the current OCCI specification suite are:

\begin{description}
\item[OCCI Core] describes the formal definition of the the OCCI Core Model
\cite{occi:core}.
\item[OCCI HTTP Rendering] defines how to interact with the OCCI Core Model using the
RESTful OCCI API \cite{occi:http_rendering}. The document defines how the OCCI Core Model can
be communicated and thus serialised using the HTTP protocol.
\item[OCCI Infrastructure] contains the definition of the OCCI Infrastructure
extension for the IaaS domain \cite{occi:infrastructure}. The document defines
additional resource types, their attributes and the actions that can be taken
on each resource type.
\end{description}
