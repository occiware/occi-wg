  <para>The document describes a slim and extensible Interface for
  Infrastructre as a Service (IaaS) model based Clouds. The document consist
  of several modular parts which each can be used without the others. After a
  walkthrough the OCCI Core is described followed up by some renderings. Those
  parts can be seen as mandatory. For usage in IaaS based Clouds the
  Infrastructure part of OCCI is described next. Finally the Registries are
  summed up.</para>

    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>The OCCI Specification is very modulare and consist of several
    parts. OCCI core specification forms the foundation of this and upcoming
    specification parts. The focus for this deliverable is on virtual
    workloads which can be deployed on 'Infrastructure as a Service' based
    Clouds. Therefore the second part describes the OCCI Infrastructure. Also
    a rendering is provided which makes this specification ready to
    implement.</para>

    <para>For future developements renderings might change. As well as other
    parts of the Cloud stack can be described using the OCCI Core as a
    foundation.</para>
